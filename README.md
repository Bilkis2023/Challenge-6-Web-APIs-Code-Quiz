# Acceptance Criteria

   - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  
   - When answer is clicked, the next question appears
   
   - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

  - The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.
